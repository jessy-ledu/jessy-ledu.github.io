title: 'Climate Change, Emissions & Demography: A Global Data Analysis'
jupyter: python3
---


### Project Context

This project is part of a **data science career-building portfolio**, designed to showcase the use of **Python for data analysis and visualization** in the context of real-world, global-scale issues.

The goal is to publish a well-documented, insightful notebook on Kaggle that demonstrates:
- Data cleaning and wrangling
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Regression and dimensionality reduction (PCA)
- Geographic visualization
- Interpretation and communication of findings

### Data Sources

This analysis uses **freely available, reputable datasets** from:
- [IMF Climate Change Indicators Dashboard](https://climatedata.imf.org/pages/climatechange-data)
- [World Bank Open Data](https://data.worldbank.org/)

### Objective

We explore how countries vary in:
- Climate change trends (°C/decade)
- Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
- Population growth

Through this, we aim to uncover global patterns and inequalities in **climate impact**, **contribution**, and **demographic change**, using accessible modeling techniques such as **linear regression** and **PCA**.

---

This notebook not only addresses a critical global issue, but also serves as a practical demonstration of **end-to-end data analysis in Python** for potential collaborators or employers.

> **Disclaimer**: This notebook is intended as a **data science portfolio project**, not a scientific publication.  
> It uses publicly available data and simplified models to explore global patterns in climate, emissions, and population.  
> While care was taken to ensure accuracy, the analysis is exploratory in nature and meant primarily to demonstrate **technical and analytical skills** in Python.


### Final Takeaway

PCA helped to uncover the **asymmetry between climate impact and contribution**, supporting the need for **differentiated responsibilities** and **tailored adaptation strategies** in international climate policy.

## Conclusion

This project confirms that **climate change is a global process**, with every country showing some degree of warming over the last six decades. However, the **impact**, **contribution**, and **capacity to respond** vary widely across countries:

- **No country is cooling**, but some—like **Zimbabwe (ZWE)** and **Moldova (MDA)**—are warming faster despite low emissions and limited growth.
- Major emitters—such as **USA** and **China (CHN)**—have significantly higher GHG outputs but are not necessarily the most climatically impacted.
- Countries with **rapid population or economic growth** (e.g., **UAE, ARE**; **Qatar,QAT**) often show **lower climate trend intensities**, possibly reflecting their geographic positioning or economic buffering.

Through **correlation analysis**, **regression models**, and **PCA**, we revealed structural imbalances:  
> Many countries facing the steepest climate consequences have **contributed the least** to global emissions, underlining a critical issue of **climate justice**.

### Skills Demonstrated

This notebook also serves as a **portfolio project** to showcase end-to-end data science capabilities:

- **Data ingestion** from open-access sources (IMF, World Bank)
- **Data cleaning & integration** across country-level datasets
- **Exploratory data analysis (EDA)** using statistical summaries and correlation metrics
- **Geospatial visualization** of global trends with Matplotlib, Seaborn, and GeoPandas
- **Regression modeling** (linear, log, exponential)
- **Dimensionality reduction** with PCA for pattern recognition
- **Narrative storytelling** with Markdown to communicate insights clearly
