### Project Context

This project is part of a **data science career-building portfolio**, designed to showcase the use of **Python for data analysis and visualization** in the context of real-world, global-scale issues.

The goal is to publish a well-documented, insightful notebook on Kaggle that demonstrates:
- Data cleaning and wrangling
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Regression and dimensionality reduction (PCA)
- Geographic visualization
- Interpretation and communication of findings

### Data Sources

This analysis uses **freely available, reputable datasets** from:
- [IMF Climate Change Indicators Dashboard](https://climatedata.imf.org/pages/climatechange-data)
- [World Bank Open Data](https://data.worldbank.org/)

### Objective

We explore how countries vary in:
- Climate change trends (Â°C/decade)
- Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
- Population growth

Through this, we aim to uncover global patterns and inequalities in **climate impact**, **contribution**, and **demographic change**, using accessible modeling techniques such as **linear regression** and **PCA**.

This notebook not only addresses a critical global issue, but also serves as a practical demonstration of **end-to-end data analysis in Python** for potential collaborators or employers.

> **Disclaimer**: This notebook is intended as a **data science portfolio project**, not a scientific publication.  
> It uses publicly available data and simplified models to explore global patterns in climate, emissions, and population.  
> While care was taken to ensure accuracy, the analysis is exploratory in nature and meant primarily to demonstrate **technical and analytical skills** in Python.
