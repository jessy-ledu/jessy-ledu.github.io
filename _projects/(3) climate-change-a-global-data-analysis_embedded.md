### Global analysis of warming, emissions, and population using Python.
### Project Context

This project is part of a **data science career-building portfolio**, designed to showcase the use of **Python for data analysis and visualization** in the context of real-world, global-scale issues.

The goal is to publish a well-documented, insightful notebook on Kaggle that demonstrates:
- Data cleaning and wrangling
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Regression and dimensionality reduction (PCA)
- Geographic visualization
- Interpretation and communication of findings

### Data Sources

This analysis uses **freely available, reputable datasets** from:
- [IMF Climate Change Indicators Dashboard](https://climatedata.imf.org/pages/climatechange-data)
- [World Bank Open Data](https://data.worldbank.org/)

### Objective

We explore how countries vary in:
- Climate change trends (Â°C/decade)
- Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
- Population growth

Through this, we aim to uncover global patterns and inequalities in **climate impact**, **contribution**, and **demographic change**, using accessible modeling techniques such as **linear regression** and **PCA**.

---

This notebook not only addresses a critical global issue, but also serves as a practical demonstration of **end-to-end data analysis in Python** for potential collaborators or employers.

> **Disclaimer**: This notebook is intended as a **data science portfolio project**, not a scientific publication.  
> It uses publicly available data and simplified models to explore global patterns in climate, emissions, and population.  
> While care was taken to ensure accuracy, the analysis is exploratory in nature and meant primarily to demonstrate **technical and analytical skills** in Python.

##  Linear Temperature Trends by Country (Â°C/decade)
Since a linear model can effectively approximate the observed trends at both global and local scales, we applied simple linear regression to each countryâ€™s time series data to quantify changes in climate indicators such as surface temperature. The slope of the fitted line represents the average rate of temperature change per year, which we then scaled to Â°C per decade for more straightforward interpretation and comparison across regions.

### Why Linear Regression?

Linear regression is a straightforward method to model long-term trends, offering a **first-order estimate** of how an indicator changes over time. It captures:

-  **The direction** of change (warming or cooling)
-  **The rate** of change (slope in Â°C/year â†’ Â°C/decade)
-  While it doesn't capture non-linear effects or fluctuations, it's widely used as a baseline trend indicator.

### ðŸ”º Top 5 Countries with the **Largest Warming Trends** (Â°C/decade)

| Country | Trend (Â°C/decade) |
|---------|------------------:|
| Zimbabwe (ZWE) | **0.148** |
| Ukraine (UKR) | 0.076 |
| Moldova (MDA) | 0.075 |
| Azerbaijan (AZE) | 0.067 |
| Georgia (GEO) | 0.066 |

These countries are experiencing the **fastest warming**, with Zimbabwe showing a particularly steep trend of nearly **0.15Â°C per decade**, well above the global average.

---

### ðŸ”» Top 5 Countries with the **Smallest Positive Warming Trends** (Â°C/decade)

| Country | Trend (Â°C/decade) |
|---------|------------------:|
| Chile (CHL) | 0.009 |
| Yemen (YEM) | 0.012 |
| French Polynesia (PYF) | 0.013 |
| Timor-Leste (TLS) | 0.013 |
| Argentina (ARG) | 0.013 |

These countries still show warming, but at a **much slower pace**, close to **0.01Â°C per decade**, which may reflect regional climatic factors, buffering effects, or measurement variability.

---

### No Cooling Countries Identified

** No countries show a stable or cooling trend (â‰¤ 0 Â°C/decade).**

This suggests that, according to the linear trend from 1961â€“2022, **every country with sufficient data** is experiencing some level of warming. This aligns with the broader global warming consensus observed in both satellite and ground station data.

### Conclusion and Final Map

Linear-trend analysis provides a clear, comparable metric for warming rates across countries. Most nations with available data show increasing surface temperaturesâ€”a hallmark of global warmingâ€”though the pace varies substantially by region.

The map below displays this distribution; the color gradient indicates the magnitude of change (Â°C per decade).

## Global Warming Trends Visualized on the World Map

To complement our quantitative analysis, we mapped the **linear temperature trends** by country across the globe. Each country is colored based on its **warming rate (Â°C/decade)**, derived from simple linear regression on its historical temperature data (1961â€“2022).

###  What Does the Map Show?

- **All countries** with sufficient data show a **positive trend**, confirming that **no region is cooling** over the long term.
- **Darker shades** represent countries experiencing **slower warming**.

### Regional Highlights

- **Northern countries**â€”including **Russia**, **Eastern Europe**, and **Canada**â€”stand out with **higher warming trends**. This reflects a well-known climate phenomenon:  
  >  **Polar and sub-polar amplification**, where higher latitudes warm faster due to snow/ice feedbacks and changes in atmospheric circulation.

- **Equatorial and some Southern Hemisphere countries** show **weaker warming trends**, though still positive. These include parts of **South America**, **Southeast Asia**, and **Oceania**.

###  Interpretation Notes

- This map provides an intuitive, spatial view of how climate change is **unevenly distributed**, despite being **global phenomenon**.
- Geographic patterns help identify **climate hotspots**, support **policy targeting**, and inspire **region-specific climate adaptation strategies**.

## Factors influencing global warming- studying impacting factors at global and local scales

To explain the observed global trendâ€”or at least to identify variables that correlate with itâ€”we will analyze additional demographic indicators alongside greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, assessing patterns at both the global and country-specific levels.

## Average Population Growth Rate (% per year)

We compute the **average annual population growth rate** using:

**Average Annual Growth Rate (% per year)** is computed as:  
$ \text{Growth Rate (\%/year)} = \frac{\ln(P_{\text{end}}) - \ln(P_{\text{start}})}{\text{years}} \times 100 $


This assumes **exponential growth** and enables fair comparison across countries.

     width="100%" 
     style="border:0;">
     
### What the Map Shows

- **Fastest-growing populations** are mostly in **Sub-Saharan Africa** (e.g., Niger, Angola, Chad) and parts of **Central Asia**.
- **Slow or negative growth** is seen in **Russia**, **Western Europe** (e.g., Italy, Germany), and **some Eastern European** countries.
- **Eastern Europe** shows mixed patterns: some countries (e.g., Bulgaria) are shrinking, while others (e.g., Uzbekistan) grow faster.

These trends reflect a complex mix of **birth rates, aging, migration**, and **economic conditions** across regions.

### Interpreting the Map

- **Carbon dioxide (COâ‚‚)** emissions generally show an upward trend in countries such as **China, India, and the United States**, while parts of **Western Europe** display stable or slightly declining trends.  
- **Fluorinated gases (F-gases)** exhibit largely stagnant emissions globally, with increases mostly concentrated in countries with high COâ‚‚ emissions.  
- **Methane (CHâ‚„)** emissions present contrasting patterns: **Northern countries** (e.g., Canada, Northern Europe) often show decreasing trends, whereas **Southern and densely populated countries** like China, India, and Brazil display increasing trends.  
- **Nitrous oxide (Nâ‚‚O)** emissions are increasing in countries including China, India, Brazil, and the United States, while trends are declining or stable in **Northern and Eastern European countries** and Russia.

Overall, total GHG trends reflect a **divergence between countries**: some are increasing emissions by up to **+200 Mt COâ‚‚e per decade**, while others are decreasing by similar magnitudes.

---

The following map shows the **cumulative GHG emissions for each country** from **1970 to 2023**, providing insight into long-term contributions:

### Interpreting Cumulative Emissions

Cumulative emissions highlight that countries with **declining current trends** can still be among the **largest historical emitters**. For example:

- **Europe and Russia**: Emissions are decreasing now, but have historically contributed a significant share.  
- **United States and China**: These countries remain among the **highest emitters historically and currently**, maintaining substantial emissions.  
- **Africa, Latin America, and the Indo-Pacific region**: Cumulative contributions remain relatively small on a global scale.

Note that Alaska is grouped with the United States in this analysis, so it shares the same color on the map. While permafrost thawing in Alaska does release some greenhouse gases, primarily methane, its contribution is small compared to the overall emissions from the United States and other major industrial sources.
